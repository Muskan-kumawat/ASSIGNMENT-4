## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

This Python program performs the following operations:
**2.1 Write User Input to a File:**
    -It prompts the user to input text that will be written to a file named output.txt.
    -The program opens the file in write mode (this creates the file if it doesn't exist) and writes the text input by the user.
**2.2 Append Data to the File:**
    -After the initial writing, the program asks the user for additional text to append to the file.
    -The program opens the file in append mode and writes the new text at the end of the existing content in the file.
**2.3 Display Final Content of the File:**
    -After appending the new text, the program reads the entire content of the file and displays it, allowing the user to see the final result
